This folder contains the recordings of the received signals and the bit labels of the transmitted signals at each distance from 0.5m to 5m at 0.5m increments.
Excel files containing the invidual bit signals of the received signals used as input to the neural network are too large and cannot be uploaded. 
Use MATLAB "Split_bits.m" file to split the bits magnified files into the separate bits for demodulation using the network.
