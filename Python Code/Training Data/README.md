The training data contains 1000 bit signals and the bit labels contain the corresponding labels for the 1000 bits. 
In the actual training of the neural network the data of 10000 bit signals were used, but the file was too large to be uploaded onto GitHub.
The 10000 bit signals training data can be generated using the MATLAB files provided in a separate folder in this repository.
